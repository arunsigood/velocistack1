## Introduction
### What is Velocistack?
Velocistack is a free and open solution for streamlined host-based forensics and investigation.

- Collect forensic artifacts
- Post-process collections
- Visualize collections or hunt results
- Create cases for investigation
- Enrich results with additional context

### Why was Velocistack created?

To allow individuals to quickly spin up a local, integrated environment for analysis and investigation of forensic artifacts collected by Velociraptor, using popular free and open tools.

### Who should use Velocistack?

- Analysts
- Incident Responders
- Students
- Anyone!

## Getting started
### Pre-reqs
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04, although 18.04 should work as well (or other distros)
- Docker should be installed.
- The Docker Compose plugin should be installed: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

### Clone
```
git clone https://github.com/weslambert/velocistack && cd velocistack
```

### Run the installer script
`sudo ./install_velocistack`

### Authentication
Currently, authentication occurs primarily through Velociraptor. It proxies all services, except for IRIS and IntelOwl

#### IntelOwl credentials:
Create superuser credentials for IntelOwl by running the following command from the CLI:

`sudo docker exec -ti uwsgi python3 manage.py createsuperuser`


### Web Access
#### Velociraptor
`https://$YOURIP/velocistack`

#### Cyberchef
